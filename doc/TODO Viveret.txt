TODO: A list of what needs to be acomplished for Viveret

Terrain design
options
AI (Once im done with teh AI stats)
Some attack animations
and textures (If you can)

What kind of terrain design / options are you looking for? I can implement some utility that I can pipe into a menu, and I can work on an in-game editor for the map.

terrain design would be how to implement Caves and stuff into the game
and maybe on how to do randomly generated villages
Well, for now, I can work on random terrain.
options would be like sound- Music- effects- dificulty

So for the terrain, is it completely random, or are certain areas always the same?
completlely
How are we going to set pre-planned locations?
I think most of the overworld should be pre-planned, with rogue areas random, and most caves / dungeons random.
So villages for the story are static, but maybe some are random.
Designated areas can be random.
well. we could have like 4000 blocks preset
Places that we don't need to be designed.
then the rest behond that could be random
I thought about that, but thats not as fun.
so we should do the main spots pre-set. then the stuff inbetween random?
Yes. But we can have some flexibility. Like a preset village can still be at a random height, on the terrain.
And cave locations can be random, but they are still required and pre-set
