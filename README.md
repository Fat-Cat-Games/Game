Map Size- 5000x5000 meters

Houses
------
I thought that I could make the faces of the houses in GIMP. and then import them (Like a texture) onto multiple planes.

Weapons
-------
I can make them in blender and then add a simple swinging/slashing animation to them. Then I can make a script so when you press "Left Mouse Button" it will play the animation.

AI
---
I don't really know how im going to make them yet. I have a script, But its not very good. I think I may know a few people that could help us with it though.
